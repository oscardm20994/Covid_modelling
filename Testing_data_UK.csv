,,,
Note: People tested refers to people who have newly been tested for COVID-19 and does not include people who have had more than one test.,,,
Data has been de-duplicated so people who have multiple tests in both pillars 1 and 2 only appear once.,,,
"If a person is tested under both pillar 1 and pillar 2, then only the pillar they were first tested under is counted.",,,
,,,
This data is not directly comparable with data in the NHS test and trace time series due to difference in the dates at which the data was extracted.,,,
